# Hi there, I'm Jacopo 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! By day, I work with medical imaging and 3D visualization, but this space is where I explore side projects and experiment with ideas that spark my curiosity.

- **Data analysis and visualization** - Turning numbers into insights
- **Python utilities** - Automating the boring stuff
- **Fitness tracking tools** - Because I'm also a runner who loves data 🏃
